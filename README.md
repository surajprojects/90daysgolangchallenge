# 90 Days of GoLang Challenge

Welcome to my **90 Days of GoLang 🚀** repo!  
I’m learning Go from [Go by Example](https://gobyexample.com) and documenting my progress day-by-day with simple, clean code examples.

## What's Inside?

Each day = a separate folder or file containing examples of Go concepts I learned that day.

| Day | Topic        | Code File              |
|-----|--------------|------------------------|
| 1   | Hello World  | `day1-hello.go`        |
| 2   | Value Types  | `day2-values.go`       |
| 3   | Variables    | `day3-variables.go`    |
| 4   | Constants    | `day4-constants.go`    |
| 5   | For Loop     | `day5-for.go`          |
| 6   | If / Else    | `day6-ifelse.go`       |
| ... | Coming soon  | Stay tuned 😎          |

> Each file is standalone. Run them directly with:
```bash
go run dayX-topic.go
```

## Why I'm Doing This?

- To build daily routine & momentum 💪  
- To deeply understand Go fundamentals 🧠  
- To share progress and inspire others 👨‍💻
